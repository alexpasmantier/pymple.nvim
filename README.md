# üñçÔ∏è pymple.nvim
This plugin adds essential missing Python IDE features for Neovim when dealing with imports: automatic import updates on module/package rename and code-action-like import resolution.
## TL;DR
**Automatic import updates on file/dir move/rename**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Here is the default configuration:

```lua
default_config = {
  -- automatically register the following keymaps on plugin setup
  keymaps = {
    -- Resolves import for symbol under cursor.
    -- This will automatically find and add the corresponding import to
    -- the top of the file (below any existing doctsring)
    add_import_for_symbol_under_cursor = {
      keys = "<leader>li", -- feel free to change this to whatever you like
      desc = "Resolve import under cursor", -- description for the keymap
    },
  },
  -- options for the update imports feature
  update_imports = {
    -- the filetypes on which to run the update imports command
    -- NOTE: this should at least include "python" for the plugin to
    -- actually do anything useful
    filetypes = { "python", "markdown" },
  },
  -- options for the add import to buffer feature
  add_import_to_buf = {
    -- whether to autosave the buffer after adding the import (which will
    -- automatically format/sort the imports if you have on-save autocommands)
    autosave = true,
  },
  -- logging options
  logging = {
    -- whether or not to log to a file (default location is nvim's
    -- stdpath("data")/pymple.vlog which will typically be at
    -- `~/.local/share/nvim/pymple.vlog` on unix systems)
    file = {
      enabled = true,
      path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/pymple.vlog",
      -- the maximum number of lines to keep in the log file (pymple will
      -- automatically manage this for you so you don't have to worry about
      -- the log file getting too big)
      max_lines = 1000,
    },
    -- whether to log to the neovim console (only use this for debugging
    -- as it might quickly ruin your neovim experience)
    console = {
      enabled = false,
    },
    -- the log level to use
    -- (one of "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal")
    level = "debug",
  },
  -- python options
  python = {
    -- the names of virtual environment folders to look out for when
    -- discovering a project
    virtual_env_names = { "venv", ".venv", "env", ".env", "virtualenv", ".virtualenv" },
    -- the names of root markers to look out for when discovering a project
    root_markers = { "pyproject.toml", "setup.py", ".git", "manage.py" },
  },
}
```


## üöÄ Usage
### ü¶Ä Import updates on file move/rename
If you're using a file explorer such as `neo-tree` or `nvim-tree`, pymple will automatically detect it and setup the appropriate hooks.  

When you rename or move a file or directory, you'll be prompted with a confirmation window and be able to preview the pending changes while discarding the ones you don't want.

While inside the preview window, the current mappings are defined by default:

| keybinding      | action                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `<CR>`          |      Confirm and update the imports     |
| `<C-k>`         |       Move to the previous change       |
| `<C-j>`         |         Move to the next change         |
| `<C-i>` or `dd` |              Discard change             |
| `<C-c>` or `q`  | Cancel refactoring and close the window |

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d10c97dc-a2cd-4a0c-8c4f-d34456362e8b

If you're not using a file explorer, the current alternative would be to manually call `:PympleUpdateImports <source> <destination>` after the file rename operation which will bring up the confirmation window mentioned above.

### ü¶Ä Import resolution
By default, pymple will setup a keymap for this (`<leader>li`) which you can change in the configuration:
```lua
  -- automatically register the following keymaps on plugin setup
  keymaps = {
    -- Resolves import for symbol under cursor.
    -- This will automatically find and add the corresponding import to
    -- the top of the file (below any existing doctsring)
    add_import_for_symbol_under_cursor = {
      keys = "<leader>li", -- feel free to change this to whatever you like
      desc = "Resolve import under cursor", -- description for the keymap
    },
  },
```

When inside a python buffer, with the cursor on any importable symbol, pressing the above keymap will perform the following action:
- **if the symbol resolves to a unique import candidate:** add that import to the top of the file (after eventual docstrings) and automatically save the file to run any import sorting/formatting autocommands;
- **if there are multiple candidates:** prompt the user to select the right one and perform step above;
- **if there are no candidates matching the symbol:** Print a warning message to notify the user.

## üÜò Help
If something's not working as expected, start by running `checkhealth` inside of neovim to check all your requirements are setup correctly:
```vim
:checkhealth pymple
```

The helpfiles might be of help too:
```lua
:help pymple.txt
```
<img width="713" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-21 at 21 24 44" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186d1e3a-1ed0-42d2-af95-d93e82f4bc78">

If that doesn't help, try activating logging and checking the logs for any errors:
```lua
require("pymple").setup({
  logging = {
    file = {
      enabled = true,
      path = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/pymple.vlog",
      max_lines = 1000, -- feel free to increase this number
    },
    -- this might help in some scenarios
    console = {
      enabled = false,
    },
    level = "debug",
  },
})
```
If you're running a regular unix system, you'll most likely find the logs in `~/.local/share/nvim/pymple.vlog` .

*NOTE*: if you have trouble filtering through the logs, or if you just like colors, maybe [this](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/tree-sitter-vlog) might interest you.






If that doesn't help, feel free to open an issue.
